To get web assembly to work:
    1. add " wasm-bindgen = "0.2.84" " to the dependencies list in Cargo.toml
    2. put " use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*; " at the top of the script
    3. put " #[wasm_bindgen] " above the variables to be accessible in the web assembly
    4. build with wasm-pack instead of cargo " wasm-pack build "
